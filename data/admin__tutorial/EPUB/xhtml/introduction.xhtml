    <p>Welcome to this tutorial !</p>
    <p>This tutorialÂ is going to teach you gently the basics of this epub3 editor, so that you could be effective in using it, and why not, like it.</p>
    <p>Learning by doing is probably the best approach to become familiar with a new tool. Beginning with the next chapter, you are going to make modifications directly wihtin this book, which will serve you as a training place.</p>
    <p>The first thing you will want to do, in order to be able to perform the exercises multiple times, or more simply not to erase someone else's work, is to copy this book, work on your own copy, and leave this original version intact.</p>
    <p>To make a copy, go back to the bookshelf using the top-left-most button; in the table presenting books already loaded, find this one and click on the <strong>copy </strong>button on its right. Once you have done this, you can start working, seriously beginning in chapter 1. See you there! You will find it in the table of contents, on the left, after you have opened your fresh copy of course.</p>
