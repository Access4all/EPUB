    <p>It's now time to look at interactive activities. We will see two of them here, but don't hesitate to try out other ones.</p>
    <h2 role="heading" aria-level="2" id="h2_2015_02_18_15_54_56_9055_2">5.1. Multiple choice quiz</h2>
    <p>This is probably the most known and the most frequent interactive activity. To create a new multiple choice quiz, choose its type in the <strong>New file </strong>tab.</p>
    <p>Go to the <strong>Quiz time!</strong> page to have an example which to experiment with.</p>
    <h2 role="heading" aria-level="2" id="h2_2015_02_18_15_54_56_9055_3">5.2. Fill in the gaps</h2>
    <p>This is another form of activity which is well known: a text with gaps to fill in.</p>
    <p>Select this type in the <strong>new file </strong>tab, or see an example in the <strong>Gap time!</strong> page.</p>
