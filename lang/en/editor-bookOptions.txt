DDBTTipp=When you import files into your book, you can decide where they should go by default in the book's folders. This can greatly help you better organize your book when it is composed of many documents, images and other files. You can leave these fields blank if you have no preference, no wish to enforce a given directory structure, or if you don't want to use this functionality.
