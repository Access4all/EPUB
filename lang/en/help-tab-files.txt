<p>The « Files » tab lists files present within the epub3 book in a tree view. 
You will find there your text HTML documents, but also images, videos, fonts, and other resources that make up the whole book
You can here simply find and open one of the files, but also make other typical operations: rename, move, delete, and send new files.</p>
<ul>
<li>To rename, move or delete a file, use the context menu.
You can also move files by drag and drop.</li>
<li>You can send new files into the book by dragging files from the explorer and dropping them onto this tab.
Alternatively, you can use the « Import files » tab to do it without mouse.</li>
</ul>
<p>From this tab, you can also insert images and videos to the currently loaded document.
To do that, drag and drop a file from this tab to the edition area. A dialog box will ask you additional information to complete the insertion, such as alternative text for images for example. 
You can do this operation without mouse using the option « Copy URL address » in the context menu, and then pasting it into the document at the desired location.
</p><p>You can also drag and drop or paste a file or a link directly in the edition area to insert it into the current document; if needed, a file will be uploaded and placed in the file tree view at an appropriate location depending on the file type.</p>
<p>Tipp: during a drag and drop operation, stay still a few seconds on a folder to open or close it.</p>
