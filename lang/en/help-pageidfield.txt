The identifier is a mean for the system to uniquely recognize this resource within the book
If you don't give one, it will be automatically generated based on the title of the document or the file name already given. In general, you don't need to precise one explicitely, as this name is only used internally.
You may ahve to indicate it explicitely in case of conflict, or if you plan to edit the epub3 book manually.
