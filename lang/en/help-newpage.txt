<p>Thank to the « New HTML file » tab, you can add new documents, and therefore contents, to your book.
In reality, a book is composed of a set of documents and files which forms its contents.</p>
<p>If you want to add images and not documents, see the « Import files » tab.</p>
<p>To add a new file, you have essentially to choose a title and the type of contents it is going to contain.</p>
<p>The title of the file is the one that may appear in the reader's interface, as window title when he's reading this file for example.
In general, this title should also be the one that starts the textual contents of the document; this should be the case if you create a distinct file for each chapter or each subchapter of your book, what is recommanded; but it may not be the case, for example if the document contains several chapters one after eachother.
</p><p> The title you choose here is used to derive a file name and an identifier if you don't define them explicitely, too (see under « Advanced » for more info on the topic).</p>
<p>The type of document determines the kind of contents you are going to put it in. Most of files will be regular documents: they will contain text and illustrations.
Other types allow you to create interactive contents, such as a multiple choice quiz.</p>
